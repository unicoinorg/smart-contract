> ðŸ¦„ Unicoin (MYTH) ERC20 Token Smart Contract

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/unicoinorg/unicoin-smart-contract.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/unicoinorg/unicoin-smart-contract)

## Dev

### Compile

```
$ yarn build
```

### Test

Run a local Ethereum testnet:

```
$ yarn ethereum
```

Then start the tests in a new session:

```
$ yarn test
```

The tests will automatically connect to the local testnet.

### Debug

Run a local Ethereum testnet:

```
$ yarn ethereum
```

Then start a new session and deploy the smart contract to your local testnet:

```
$ yarn deploy:local
```

You can now connect an Ethereum client such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet to your local testnet at `http://localhost:8545` and interact with your smart contract.

## Deploy

Create a mnemonic seed and an [Infura](infura.io) API key. Add them to a `.env` file in the root of this repository:

```
MNEMONIC="south rookie tag unhappy hurt gate ability include excess range cake sunset"
INFURA_TOKEN="9NdhEXkpSFjE4DSBwX3s"
```

### Deploy to Testnet

Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum Ropsten test network:

```
$ yarn deploy:testnet
```

> **Tip:** You will need to obtain some free testnet Ether from a faucet before you can deploy.

### Deploy to Mainnet

Deploy the smart contract to the main Ethereum network:

```
$ yarn deploy:mainnet
```

> **Warning:** Deployment to mainnet will pay gas costs from the first address derived from your mnemonic.

## Flatten

Concat Solidity files with all of their dependencies:

```
$ yarn flatten contracts/UnicoinToken.sol
```

Helps you to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io), or debug it on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), by merging your files and their dependencies in the right order.
